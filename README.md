# rollbackversionbatch
Simple roll back for vm's something simple. Always willing to learn how to do it better. 

Just messing with this to get used to git hub but i have code in it for grabbing a old raw data file for vm's and copy them and move them to a new directory in a bash script.

Its very long, im sure i could make the lines alot smaller. Wrote this in sort of a frantic jsut messing with ways to do it more interactively.
